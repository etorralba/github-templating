# GitHub Good Practices
_[GitHub Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart)_
- The title should **convey at a glance what the issue is about.**
- Add a **description that explains the purpose** of the issue, including any details that might help resolve the issue.
- It can be helpful to **break large issues into smaller tasks,** or to track multiple related issues in a single larger issue.
- Add a **label to categorize** your issue.
- You can add a **milestone to track the issue** as part of a date based target.
- To communicate responsibility, you can **assign the issue to a member** of your organization.


## Templates
For pull request templates a `.github/pull_request_template.md` should be created. This would be the default template that GitHub will show when a PR is created.

- `fixes #[ISSUE_ID]` - Automatically close issue (_close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves, resolved are all the keywords to close issues_)
